multiple choice guessing game

This is a trivia form/game based on Bob's Burgers.
It is a multiple choice or true/false options question game using radio buttons.

The player will have a limited amount of time (30 second) to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the time runs out or the player clicks the 'done' button. 

If the player runs out of a time - an alert will appear notifying the player that time has run out.
The page will then reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly or did not complete.

If the player selects done: the page will still generate the number of correct vs incorrect answers the questions the player completed.
